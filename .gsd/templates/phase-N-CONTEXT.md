## Preferences

### Code Style
- [Preference 1 - e.g., "Functional components over class components"]
- [Preference 2 - e.g., "Explicit error handling, no silent failures"]

### Architecture
- [Preference 1 - e.g., "Keep business logic separate from UI"]
- [Preference 2 - e.g., "Single responsibility per module"]
