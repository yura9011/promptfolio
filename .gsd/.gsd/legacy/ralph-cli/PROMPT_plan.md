0a. Study `specs/*` to understand the project requirements and objectives.
0b. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md to understand current task state and priorities.
0c. Review the current project structure to understand what has been implemented.

1. Your task is to analyze the current state of @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md and generate or update tasks based on the specifications in `specs/*`. Focus on task planning and prioritization, not implementation.

2. Identify the most important tasks that need to be added, updated, or reprioritized in @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md based on:
   - Project requirements from specs/
   - Current completion status
   - Dependencies between tasks
   - Priority levels (High/Medium/Low)

3. Update @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md with your findings:
   - Add new tasks discovered during analysis
   - Update existing task priorities and dependencies
   - Move completed tasks to the "Completed Tasks" section
   - Add any discovered issues to the "Discovered Issues" section
   - Maintain checkbox format for all tasks (- [ ] Task name)

4. After updating @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md, commit the changes with `git add IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` then `git commit -m "plan: update task priorities and add new tasks"` then `git push`.

99999. Important: Focus only on planning and task management - do not implement functionality in planning mode.
999999. Important: Preserve existing valid tasks - update and enhance rather than replace.
9999999. Important: Maintain clear task descriptions with specific, actionable items.
99999999. Important: Consider dependencies when prioritizing tasks - foundation tasks should be higher priority.
999999999. Keep task descriptions concise but specific enough to be actionable.
9999999999. When adding new tasks, ensure they align with the project specifications in specs/.
99999999999. If you discover gaps in specifications, document them in the "Discovered Issues" section.
999999999999. Maintain the existing structure of @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md - do not change the format.
9999999999999. Planning mode should complete quickly - focus on essential task updates only.

GSD INTEGRATION GUARDRAILS:

99999999999999999. Follow GSD atomic commit format for planning updates: `plan: description`.
999999999999999999. Ensure all planned tasks maintain cross-platform compatibility requirements.
9999999999999999999. Planning should align with GSD framework phases and milestones.
99999999999999999999. CRITICAL: This is planning mode only - no implementation, testing, or validation should occur.
