# User Communication Pattern: Direct Spanish Commands

## Pattern Description

User communicates in Spanish with specific command patterns that signal execution intent and urgency level.

## Key Phrases

- **"si"** = Yes, execute immediately, no more questions
- **"si go"** = Full speed ahead, maximum velocity
- **"ambas"** = Do both/all things mentioned
- **"migrar ahora"** = Migrate now, execute immediately
- **"phase N"** = Proceed to phase N

## Communication Style

1. **Language Mix**: Spanish for communication, English for code/commands
2. **Direct**: Values action over explanation
3. **Efficient**: Minimal words, maximum meaning
4. **Impatient**: Wants to see progress, not hear about plans
5. **Trusting**: Once approved, expects autonomous execution

## When This Occurs

- Throughout all interactions
- Especially when approving plans or next steps
- When frustrated with too much explanation

## Why It Matters

Understanding these patterns prevents:
- Over-explaining when user wants action
- Asking redundant questions
- Slowing down workflow with unnecessary confirmations

## How to Respond

1. **When user says "si"**: Execute immediately, minimal response
2. **When user says "si go"**: Maximum velocity, show progress not plans
3. **When user says "ambas"**: Do everything mentioned, don't ask which
4. **When user speaks Spanish**: Respond in Spanish for acknowledgment, English for technical content
5. **Always**: Prefer action over explanation

## Examples

**Good Response to "si go"**:
```
Executing Phase 3 tasks...
[shows progress]
Done. Phase 3 complete.
```

**Bad Response to "si go"**:
```
Great! I'll now proceed with Phase 3. First, I'll update ralph.ps1, 
then I'll update loop.sh, then I'll create documentation...
[long explanation]
```

## Related Patterns

## Notes for Future Agents

This user knows what they want. Trust their judgment. When they say "si", they mean it. Execute with confidence.
